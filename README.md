App to learn typescript with node/react and to have a platform to make custom coding excersies and practise them for exams / work prep. Most built-in challenges are about popular algorithms, maybe in the future specific in-depth language dependant design patterns and overall knowledge tests not only coding excersises. Monaco editor and Judge0API used. Currently unfinished.
